BoeingUUV
=========
Code for my Senior Design Project at Penn State University. We were tasked in building an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (Submarine) that was to be controlled wirelessly and could rise, dive, go forward and reverse.

"UUV2" Directory:
  - The code for the Arduino Mega 2560 and the WiShield 2.0 that controlled all the function and * connected to the
    submarine

"boeing-uuv" Directory:
  - The code for the Android tablet app that gave movement commands to the submarine and displayed positional and
    movement data that was sent back from the submarine.
